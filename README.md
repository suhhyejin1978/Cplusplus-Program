# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project that was created was to use the information provided in a text file to compile the grocery items and how many of each item was purchased.  It need three options.  The first option needed to produce a list of all the items that were purchased in a day with the number of times each item was purchased.  The second option was to show how many of a specified item was purchased.  The third option showed a text-based histogram listing the items purchased with the number of times it was purchased.
  
#What did you do particularly well?
  I feel that what I did particularly well was that I had a list provided on the second option to what items were available to choose from.  Then I made the input from the user to capitalize the first letter of the input so that it would be recognized in the function.  If an item was not selected, it would go back to the loop.
  
#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I feel like I repeated the read code often in my program.  I think I could make it more efficient by making it a separate function to reduce repetition.
  
#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  What I found most challenging to write was making the dictionary into a list.  It has been a while since I have worked with dictionaries so I had to brush up on it by looking it up on the internet and also on YouTube tutorials.  I was able to print it in dictionary form but wanted it in list form.  So I researched some more in order to get the dictionary to print as a list.  
  
#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Learning to embed Python in C++ was quite interesting.  Even though there was some preliminary coding provided to us to be able to use Python, actually writing the code to interact with both languages was something I enjoyed learning.  I feel that is a skill that will be able to transfer to other projects.  Another skill that I learned from this project is if I have an idea on how it may work, not to hesitate to try it.  If it does not work, it helps with troubleshooting and figuring out another way to get it to work.
  
#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made the program maintainable by giving the functions and variables sensible names. Since it has functions, it makes it easier to maintain and make it adaptable.  I also commented to make it understandable.  Spacing and indentation made it easier to read.
